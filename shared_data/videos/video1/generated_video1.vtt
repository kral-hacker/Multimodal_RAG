00:00.000 --> 00:08.780
 As I look back on the mission that we've had here on the International Space Station,

00:08.780 --> 00:13.300
 I'm proud to have been a part of much of the science activities that happened over the

00:13.300 --> 00:14.300
 last two months.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.180
 The view is always amazing though.

00:16.180 --> 00:21.260
 I didn't think I would do another spacewalk and to now have the chance to have done four

00:21.260 --> 00:24.980
 more was just icing on the cake for a wonderful mission.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.980
 The tenth one, do you like the first one?

00:26.980 --> 00:27.980
 No.

00:27.980 --> 00:30.280
 A little more comfortable on your tenth one.

00:30.280 --> 00:36.980
 It's hard to put into words just what it was like to be a part of this expedition, the

00:36.980 --> 00:37.980
 Expedition 63.

00:37.980 --> 00:42.280
 It'll be kind of a memory that will last a lifetime for me.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.780
 It's been a true honor.

00:43.780 --> 00:46.780
 Dragon SpaceX, Undock sequence commanded.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.340
 The roster's looking good.

00:48.340 --> 00:52.500
 The hardest part was getting us launched, but the most important part is bringing us

00:52.500 --> 00:53.000
 home.

00:55.980 --> 00:58.980
 I've been telling Daddy we love you.

00:58.980 --> 01:02.980
 Hurry home so we can go get my dog.

01:05.980 --> 01:07.980
 Flashdown.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.980
 Welcome back to Planet Earth and thanks for flying SpaceX.

01:10.980 --> 01:12.980
 It was truly our honor and proud pleasure.

01:12.980 --> 01:18.980
 Space dads are back on Earth after a 19 hour return journey from space.

01:24.980 --> 01:26.980
 Thanks for watching.
